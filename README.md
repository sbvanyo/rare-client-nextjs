## Starting the Project
1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application, and `author` to  your name.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
